# EMISApproximateEquilibrium
The Electricity Markets Investment Suite Approximate Equilibrium (EMIS-AE) package is  developed at NREL that provides a solution capability to solve generation expansion equilibrium problems in the electricity markets. EMIS-AS is designed to capture the evolution of the electricity generation portfolio resulting from the interactions of heterogeneous investors under different policy and market designs. The investment problem for each generation company (GENCO) is a bi-level problem with the investment decision made in the upper level and market clearing condition in the lower level, which traditionally is represented as a Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraint (MPEC). EMIS-AE provides a predictive model to be trained for estimating the system-wide revenues for each technology type across energy, ancillary services and capacity markets given the amount of installed capacity on the grid. The profit maximization investment problem for each GENCO is solved using a global search algorithm, which uses the predictive model to evaluate the objective function. To solve for the strategic equilibrium, each GENCOâ€™s problem is plugged into a diagonalization algorithm that is generally used in multi-leader, single-follower bi-level problems.
